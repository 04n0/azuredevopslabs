The ALM VM update is a massive exercise and takes several weeks from start and finish. I could not have it done without my team. I would like to thank the following indiviudals for their contributions and support

<table class="mainTable" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
        <td>
              <img style="vertical-align:middle; margin-top: 2px;" src="images/srivatsa.jpeg"  />
         </td>
         <td>     
               <b>Srivatsa Marichi</b> <br />Srivatsa had no clue about Markdown when we started the 2017 update but he now qualifies to have a master degree on markdown. Thanks to him for all the VSTS labs and for the new home page for the ALM VM on GitHub.
