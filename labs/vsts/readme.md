## Overview

Visual Studio Team Services and Azure cloud services help remove barriers between teams, encourage collaboration, and improve the flow of value to your customers.
Or, use our on-premises server, Team Foundation Server (TFS), when you want to maintain your data within your network.

Both options are enterprise-ready, supporting teams of any size, from tens to thousands. Team Services provides a scalable, reliable, and globally available
hosted service. It is backed by a 99.9% SLA, monitored by our 24Ã—7 operations team, and available in local data centers around the world.
Also, you can quickly expand the power of these tools through integration with other services and tools using service hooks and extensions.
