# Microsoft Teams Integration (Collaborate, Communicate and Celebrate)

## Overview

<a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/start">**Microsoft Teams**</a> is your chat-centered workspace in Office 365. Software development teams get instant access to everything they need in a dedicated
hub for teamwork, that brings your teams, conversations, content and tools from across Office 365 and Visual Studio Team Services together into one place.

> Note: This integration is currently available for Visual Studio Team Services (not Team Foundation Server).

## Pre-requisites

## Working with Kanban Boards within the Microsoft Teams

Your Kanban board turns your backlog into an interactive signboard, providing a visual flow of work. As work progresses from idea to completion, you update the items on the board. Each column represents a work stage, and each card represents a user story (blue cards) or a bug (red cards) at that stage of work.
