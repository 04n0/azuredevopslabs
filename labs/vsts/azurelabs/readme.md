## Overview

Here are some quick start guides on **Azure tools for Visual Studio** that will guide you on how you can easily build, debug, deploy, diagnose, and manage multi-platform,
scalable apps and services on Azure with Visual Studio.

Visual Studio 2015/2017 also includes the latest <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/">Azure SDK</a> providing one-click provisioning and deployment to Azure for web sites and cloud services, along with easy management
of all or your cloud resources. Whether your application is using <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/overview/what-is-paas/">IaaS or Paas in Azure</a>, built with .NET or Python or Node.js, or deploying to Windows or Linux or Docker 
containers, the cloud tools in Visual Studio 2015/2017 let you easily integrate with Azure.

On top of this, developers can also use the preview of <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/introducing-asp-net-5">ASP.NET 5</a> in Visual Studio 2015/2017. ASP.NET 5 is one of the most significant updates to the **ASP.NET** platform we’ve done.
Because ASP.NET 5 runs on the **CoreCLR**, it can be deployed to your choice of platform, whether it’s **Linux, Mac or Windows**. On top of this, **ASP.NET 5** offers foundational improvements
in rapid development, cloud configuration, dependency management and composability.

It has the following labs:
