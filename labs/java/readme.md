[Visual Studio Team Services(VSTS)](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-team-services-vs) and [Team Foundation Server (TFS)](https://www.visualstudio.com/tfs/) provide an integrated set of services and tools to manage your software projects, from planning and development through testing and deployment to speed the development and delivery of your software applications across platforms, including iOS, Android, Java, Linux or Windows. 

Team Services is the cloud offering that provides a scalable, reliable, and globally available hosted service. It is backed by a 99.9% SLA, monitored by our 24â€”7 operations team, and available in local data centers around the world.

Team Foundation Server is the on-premises offering built on a SQL Server backend. Organizations typically choose on-premises TFS when they need their data to stay within your network, or they want access to SharePoint sites and SQL Server reporting services that integrate with TFS data and tools.

## Overview  of the Java Hands-on-Lab

DevOps for Java teams with Microsoft Visual Studio Team Services hands-on-lab is provided to give you a first-hand, technical experience on how you can leverage the Microsoft DevOps platform for Java development. The labs cover both using the built-in first-party cross-platform tools and as well as using your existing tool set to build and deploy Java applications.

Thanks to our partners NorthWest Cadence for building a pre-built virtual machine image that is pre-configured with all the software you require to run through the labs. The "Creating the VM" section below has instructions on how you can run a copy of this image in your own Azure subscription.

## Target Audience

The image and the accompanying hand-on-labs is for technical audience. As such, familiarity with Visual Studio Team Services, Java and Linux operating system would be preferred although it is not a strict prerequisite.

## Creating the VM

1. Create the VM and dependent resources.
    
    Simply click the Deploy to Azure button below and follow the wizard to create the resources. You will need to log in to the Azure Portal.
                                                                     
	<a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fnwcadence%2Fjava-dev-vsts%2Fmaster%2Fenv%2FJavaDevVSTS.json" target="_blank">

	</a>
	<a href="http://armviz.io/#/?load=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fnwcadence%2Fjava-dev-vsts%2Fmaster%2Fenv%2FJavaDevVSTS.json" target="_blank">
		<img src="http://armviz.io/visualizebutton.png"/>
	</a>

    The resources will be deployed to a Resource Group. You can delete the resource group in order to remove all the created resources at any time.

	The VM will take a few minutes (~20) to complete. The VM is installing required software and configuring the environment for the labs.

If you require assistance with these labs, you can contact Northwest Cadence through their [website](http://nwcadence.com).
