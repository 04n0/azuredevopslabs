## Overview
The VM and the accompanying hands-on-labs are now updated to Visual Studio and Team Foundation Server 2017. Please see below for the instructions on how to download the virtual machine and the hands-on-labs/demo scripts.

For those who prefer not to download the virtual machine, the hands-on-labs are available on **TechNet Virtual Labs** 

This Virtual Machine is configured with:

- Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Standard Evaluation    
- Microsoft Visual Studio Enterprise 2017 RC     
- Microsoft Visual Studio Team Foundation Server 2017     
- Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2016 (Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Outlook)     
- Microsoft Visio Professional 2016     
- Microsoft SQL Server 2016 Standard     
- Sample users and data required to support hands-on-lab scripts      

## Download the Virtual Machine

The size of the download is about 30 GB. It is recommended that you use a utility like [**Free download manager**](http://www.freedownloadmanager.org/).  This utility provides:

- Auto-resume support for interrupted downloads.
- Multiple simultaneous download streams for (usually) a much faster download experience.
- As the name implies, it’s completely free.

**Steps to download and extract the VM**    

- Download and install Free download manager if you currently do not have one installed – We strongly recommend to download FDM V3 as the latest version does not support batch downloads at this point of time
fdmv3    
- Download the ALMVM 2017 Update 2 URL.txt to your machine    
- Select File-Import-Import list of downloads      
- Specify a group or accept the default group to begin downloading       
- When the download is complete, double-click the .exe file to self-extract the RAR files to a folder       
- Read the “Working with the …” document to start using the VM     

## Using the VM

There are quite a number of important instructions on how to use the VM including activating the VM, taking snapshots/check points, etc, documented. Please also see the note below at the end of the post.

Please read through the document prior to using the VM, even if you may have used the earlier version of the VM. The VM has about 15 GB of free hard disk space. Should you want to increase the size of the disk, you will need to do so before creating snapshots/check points. You can refer this article on [TechNet]() for instructions on expanding the virtual hard disk.

## Hands-On-Labs

We have converted the hands-on-labs from Word to markdown. If you want the labs in Word format, you can find them <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/almvm/tree/master/labs/Word">here</a>
