**Great News!** We have begun working on the ALM VM update for TFS and VS 2017. We estimate to complete the update and make the VM and the Hands-on-Labs publicly available by the 2nd week of March 2017.

If you have any questions, feedback or suggestions it would be great to <a href="mailto:devopsdemos@microsoft.com">hear from you.</a>

Until then stay tuned!
